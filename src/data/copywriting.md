[PROBLEM / PAIN POINTS SECTION]
Headline: Why Most Bathroom Renovations Fail Within 3 Years

Body Copy:
Many "aesthetic" renovations are merely cosmetic covers over potential disasters. They look good on day one, but hidden cracks and poor waterproofing lead to ceiling leaks, neighbor complaints, and costly hacking works later.

At [Client Brand Name], we fix the root cause. We remove ambiguity before work starts—not after problems appear.

• The Common Trap: Focusing on tiles and vanity units while neglecting the sub-floor waterproofing.
• Our Solution: A renovation engineered around failure prevention.

Sub-headline: Function Over Form. Reliability Over Aesthetics.

We specialize in Anti-Leak Bathroom Renewal—a complete overhaul carried out specifically to eliminate leak risks permanently.

1. Scientific Site Analysis
We identify existing failure points using thermal detection and moisture mapping before quoting. No guesswork.

2. Standardized Materials & Process
We don’t mix-and-match cheap compounds. We use industrial-grade waterproofing membranes and a standardized application protocol that leaves zero room for error.

3. Permanent Outcomes, Not Surface Fixes
We strip the bathroom to the bare concrete and rebuild it with a multi-layer waterproofing system. We don't do "overlay" unless it's structurally sound.

[FAQ SECTION - Optimized for SEO Snippets]
Headline: Frequently Asked Questions About Bathroom Leaks

Q: Do you do cosmetic renovations?
A: Our primary focus is Anti-Leak Renewal. While your bathroom will look brand new and modern, our design choices are dictated by what prevents leaks best, not just what is trendy.

Q: How long does the anti-leak renewal take?
A: A comprehensive leak-proof overhaul typically takes 10-14 days depending on the size of your HDB or Condo bathroom, as we allow proper curing time for waterproofing layers.

Q: Is there a warranty?
A: Yes. Because we standardize our process and materials to reduce risk, we offer a comprehensive warranty on water tightness.
